# Advanced Data Systems ðŸš€

In this repository you will find the mandatory exercise in the course *Advanced Data Systems* at the IT University.
To be more specific you will find a directory for each mandatory exercise in this course:
- `exercise-01`: Is an exercise in creating a Naive Bayes implementation in SQL and as a UDTF in a cloud native datawarehouse called Snowflake. Moreover, we had to perform TPC-H benchmarks on different warehouse sizes.
- `exercise-02`: Is an exercise in constructing a bencmark in `DuckDB` and get to know `DuckDB` better. In particular, we are implementing the Star-Schema Benchmark(SSB). The implementation is heavily inspired by the TPC-H benchmark implementation and an extension is created called `ssbgen`
- `exercise-03`: Is where we contribute a parquet operator to Apache Wayang. Afterwards, we should compare the performance of parquet source to the CSV source operator. 
Each of the directories contains a readme about what you will find in that particular directory and how to run it.
